ctypeslib/          SVN checkout of http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ctypeslib/
                    Repo: http://svn.python.org/projects/ctypes/trunk/ctypeslib/
ctypes_output/      Bindings generated from oniguruma.h
tests/              Some tests for the library
Makefile            This makefile should create the necessary files and modules
                    for you to use oniguruma.
                    
 

Porting to other platforms
==========================

If you get import errors while loading ongiuruma library, you should check
if you have both the library and the binding generated for your platform.
This binding relies on ctypeslib packages which has been included in 
this directory for simplicity reasons.

Please note the ctypeslib might have changed, and you should consider upgrading
it before trying to create the bindings.
